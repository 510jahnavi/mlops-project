# SHAP: Based on game theory, SHAP assigns each feature an importance value by measuring its contribution to the prediction. It offers consistent feature importance at both the global and local levels.
# LIME: Perturbs input data and builds an interpretable model locally around a specific prediction to show how features impact that particular outcome.
